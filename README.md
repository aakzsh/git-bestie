# Git Hit
Git-Hit is a web application that takes the GitHub username as form input, and then runs the APIs in background to get the top 3 best performing repositories of that account, sorted by the number of stars it has. It displays the top 3 repositories in a table which makes it easy to understand it better. The app also has built in try catch methods to handle wrong queries.
